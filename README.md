# Disertatie-Lucrare-Finala

My dissertation project is an IoT application, an intelligent assistant (powered by ChatGPT) with both hardware and software components, designed to help a user take care of a plant to a greater or lesser extent.  
The system integrates several modern technologies â€“ sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi board from which data is retrieved using a Python script. This data is stored in a Firebase instance and a user application developed with Java in Android Studio, which is integrated with ChatGPT.  
Here it is a short summary.  

## Hardware Part

The Raspberry Pi circuit has the following modules conected to it: AM2320( sensor for temperature and humidity), BMP280 ( sensor for temperature and atmospheric preassure), BH1750FVI ( sensor for light intensity), resistive soil moisture sensor, resistive rain sensor, water pump, 3VDC Relay, aditional power source, LED, comparator module LM393, BreadBoard, cables.
